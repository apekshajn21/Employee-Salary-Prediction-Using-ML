# Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-ML
**Salary Estimation App**
This project is a Machine Learning-based Streamlit web application that predicts an employee's salary based on:

Years at the company

Satisfaction level

Average monthly working hours

It provides a clean user interface, visualizations using Plotly, and integrates a pre-trained ML model for prediction.

** Features?*
Predict salary based on input features
 Interactive sliders for entering input
 Beautiful visualizations for:

Input profile

Salary comparison
 Warning for potential burnout conditions
 User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
 Model built using scikit-learn, joblib, and NumPy
